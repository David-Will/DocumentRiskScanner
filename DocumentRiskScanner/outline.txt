- regexes for email/phone/card numbers
- match words that Start With Capitals and narrow down to names
- (can we pull a list of possible names from some public API? like, baby names?)
- create a risk measure of each document based on number of positives (higher value for regex matches?)
- produce report that highlights most risky documents

- how do we read *any* document?
- well we can't, obviously
- but we can start with standard txt, microsoft office docs, pdfs, etc
- what are the effective ways to parse these?

- allow whitelist (ignore that document, it's public info etc etc)
- let user choose sensitivity level (show me partial matches, show me uncertain matches, etc)
- make it so it can be automated, run from terminal, obv
- potential options:
	--path [path] (if not supplied, same path as script location)

	--whitelist [path] (if not supplied, no whitelist)
