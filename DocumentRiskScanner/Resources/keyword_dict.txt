# Lines starting with hashes are comments
# Lines starting with numbers are keywords where the number represents the risk of the keyword
# 0 = low risk (generic terms, could be relevant, probably not)
# 1 = medium risk (could be part of a bigger term, could be out of context)
# 2 = high risk (sensitive terms, probably labels for info fields)
